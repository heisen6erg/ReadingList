	description: "A full-color introduction to the basics of HTML and CSS from the publishers of Wrox! Every day, more and more people want to learn some HTML and CSS. Joining the professional web designers and programmers are new audiences who need to know a little bit of code at work (update a content management system or e-commerce store) and those who want to make their personal blogs more attractive. Many books teaching HTML and CSS are dry and only written for those who want to become programmers, which is why this book takes an entirely new approach. Introduces HTML and CSS in a way that makes them accessible to everyone—hobbyists, students, and professionals—and it’s full-color throughout Utilizes information graphics and lifestyle photography to explain the topics in a simple way that is engaging Boasts a unique structure that allows you to progress through the chapters from beginning to end or just dip into topics of particular interest at your leisure This educational book is one that you will enjoy picking up, reading, then referring back to. It will make you wish other technical topics were presented in such a simple, attractive and engaging way! This book is also available as part of a set in hardcover - Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery, 9781119038634; and in softcover - Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery, 9781118907443.",

	author: "Jon Duckett",
	description: "THIS BOOK COVERS:
		Basic programming concepts - assuming no prior knowledge of programming beyond an ability to create a web page using HTML & CSS
		Core elements of the JavaScript language - so you can learn how to write your own scripts from scratch
		jQuery - which will allow you to simplify the process of writing scripts (this is introduced half-way through the book once you have a solid understanding of JavaScript)
		How to recreate techniques you will have seen on other web sites such as sliders, content filters, form validation, updating content using Ajax, and much more (these examples demonstrate writing your own scripts from scratch and how the theory you have learned is put into practice).
		As with our first book (the best-selling HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites), each chapter:
		Breaks subjects down into bite-sized chunks with a new topic on each page
		Contains clear descriptions of syntax, each one demonstrated with inspiring code samples
		Uses diagrams and photography to explain complex concepts in a visual way
		By the end of the book, not only will you be able to use the thousands of scripts, JavaScript APIs, and jQuery plugins that are freely available on the web, and be able to customize them - you will also be able to create your own scripts from scratch.

		If you're looking to create more enriching web experiences, then this is the book for you.",
